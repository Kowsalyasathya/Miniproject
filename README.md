## FORECASTING PRICES OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project uses machine learning models to predict prices of agricultural commodities, such as pulses and vegetables, based on historical price and weather data. By forecasting price trends, it aims to support market stability and assist in better planning for farmers and policymakers.

## About
This project develops machine learning models to predict prices of essential agricultural commodities like pulses, onions, and potatoes by analyzing historical price data and weather information. Utilizing techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, and regression algorithms, the project aims to capture trends and environmental impacts to provide a data-driven approach for forecasting. Ultimately, these predictions will aid in stabilizing markets and supporting informed decision-making for farmers and policymakers, reducing price volatility and improving agricultural planning.

## Features
-Data Integration: Combines weather and price data.

-Feature Engineering: Enhances model accuracy with relevant features.

-Model Selection: Utilizes Random Forest Regression.

-Visualization: Analyzes trends and price volatility.

-User Input: Customized predictions based on input.

## Output

When the model is executed, it first asks for the commodity name,
